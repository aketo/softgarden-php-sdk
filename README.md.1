softgarden PHP SDK
==================

The [softgarden-cloud API](http://dev.softgarden.de/) is
a set of APIs that connect your app to the softgarden cloud ATS.

This repository contains the open source PHP SDK that allows you to
access softgarden cloud API from your PHP app. Except as otherwise noted,
the softgarden PHP SDK is licensed under the Apache Licence, Version 2.0
(http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).


Usage
-----

The [examples][examples] are a good place to start. The minimal you'll need to
have is:

    require 'softgarden-php-sdk/src/Softgarden.php';

    $softgarden = new Softgarden(array(
      'appId'  => 'YOUR_APP_ID',
      'secret' => 'YOUR_APP_SECRET' // only required if your app has an secret
    ));

    // call an API endpoint
    $response = $softgarden->get('v2/frontend/me');

To make [API][API] calls, the general pattern is:

      try {
        // make the api call, generic
        $response = $softgarden->api('v2/frontend/me');

        // make the api call, get
        $response = $softgarden->get('v2/frontend/me', $optionalQueryParamsAsArray);

        // make the api call, post
        $response = $softgarden->post('v2/frontend/me', $optionalPostParamsAsArray);

        // make the api call, put
        $response = $softgarden->put('v2/frontend/me', $optionalPostParamsAsArray);

        // make the api call, delete
        $response = $softgarden->delete('v2/frontend/me', $optionalQueryParamsAsArray);

      } catch (SoftgardenApiException $e) {
        error_log($e);
      }
    }

Tests
-----

In order to keep us nimble and allow us to bring you new functionality, without
compromising on stability, we have ensured full test coverage of the SDK.
We are including this in the open source repository to assure you of our
commitment to quality, but also with the hopes that you will contribute back to
help keep it stable. The easiest way to do so is to file bugs and include a
test case.

The tests can be executed by using this command from the base directory:

    phpunit --stderr --bootstrap tests/bootstrap.php tests/tests.php
